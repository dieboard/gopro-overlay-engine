# Air Speed Indicator

The Air Speed Indicator component draws an air speed indicator.

The best speed indicator that exists at the moment is `speed`, but this does represent
the SOG or Ground speed, not airspeed, but it might be OK for a video overlay.

{{  <component type="asi" vs0="10" /> }}



# Critical Airspeed Indicators

The following attributes can be set to change the critical air speed indicators.

More accurate definitions are welcomed!

| Attribute | Description                                                  | 
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| vs0       | Stall speed with flaps extended in landing configuration Vs0 |
| vs | Stall speed in pre-defined configuration Vs                  |
| vfe | Maximum flap extension speed Vfe                             |
| vno | Max structural cruising speed                                | 
| vne | Never Exceed speed                                           | 


{{ <component type="asi" vs0="0" vs="30" vfe="33" vno="90" vne="100" /> }}

This could work also for a recording in a yacht? The meanings of the parameters would be changed somehow, but it might look good?

# Metrics & Conversions

The ASI defaults to speed in knots, but like a text metric, can access any available information, and convert it to
other units

{{  <component type="asi" units="mph" vs0="10" /> }}

{{  <component type="asi" metric="alt" units="feet" /> }}

# Size

The component can be sized - sizes that are too small or big might not render quite right

{{ <component type="asi" size="128" /> }}

# Rotation

Can rotate the entire gauge clockwise using `rotate`

{{ <component type="asi" rotate="45" /> }}
{{ <component type="asi" rotate="90" /> }}
{{ <component type="asi" rotate="180" /> }}

# Font

The text font can be changed in size

{{ <component type="asi" textsize="24" /> }}
